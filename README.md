# Sage
A custom bootstrap theme that I created as part of a SASS challenge

I decided to use a pastel color palette, as I found it easier on the eyes compared to the high constrast and saturated templates available on Bootstrap's website.
Additional styling on certain elements tied the whole theme together, and the result was a simple yet elegant custom theme.
